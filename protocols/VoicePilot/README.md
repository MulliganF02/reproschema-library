  <h2>Welcome to Voice Study</h2>
  <p>We are trying to understand how your voice and language provides a window into your
  mental health. By collecting this data, we are hoping to move away from having to answer
  100s of questions about your symptoms to a more objective marker that can be readily
  and privately collected.</p>

    <h3>Understand your Mental Health</h3>
    <p>Although your individual path is uncertain, seeing patterns over time may lead to a
    better  understanding of your mental well being. Tracking your medication and other
    factors (e.g. stress, exercise, noise) may provide additional insight into your symptoms
    and your ability to  complete activities.  Understanding this may provide insights into
    your day to day health and lifestyle.</p>

    <h3>Telling your story</h3>
    <p>Through Voice Up, you can tell your story of living with mental illness. Itâ€™s a tool
    to understand your symptoms, factors, and how these relate to your medication, your
    interactions, and your environment. If you do this every week, you will be able to see
    your changes over time. This can help you talk about your story with doctors and
    caregivers. It is about you and how you live with mental illness.</p>
